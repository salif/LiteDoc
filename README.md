## Project Status

LiteDoc is **stable and in maintenance mode.** v3.1.0 was the biggest release the project has had — the reconnected layout engine, real figure extraction, the CLI, and a continuous training pipeline all landed in one update — and it's a good place for the core engine to sit for a while. From here, updates will be bug fixes and small improvements as they come in rather than a fixed roadmap of new features.

The optional AI cleanup feature is temporarily offline — the cloud account hosting it was suspended with no explanation and an open-ended appeal process (see `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for the full story). This doesn't affect the core app: extraction has always run 100% in your browser, and the CLI works fully offline too. AI cleanup comes back the moment there's somewhere to host it again.

The project is open source, so if you want to keep pushing on the parser or the training pipeline yourself, everything you need is in this repo — see [Training & Heuristic Optimization](#training--heuristic-optimization) below.

## Why LiteDoc

There are incredible, industry-standard tools out there for PDF parsing, like **Markitdown** (Microsoft), **Docling** (IBM), and **Marker**. However, they are fundamentally built for automated backend pipelines, which introduces significant friction for average users.

| Feature | 🐍 Markitdown / Docling / Marker | 🌐 LiteDoc |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup Required** | `pip install`, Python environments, Docker | **Zero.** Just open a web page. |
| **Target Audience** | Backend Devs, Data Engineers, AI Pipelines | **Everyone.** Students, researchers, writers. |
| **Processing** | Local CLI or Server-side API | **100% Client-side** (WASM + JS). |
| **Privacy** | Depends on your infrastructure setup | **Absolute.** Files never leave your device. |

**LiteDoc is for people who just want their Markdown *right now*.**
No dependencies, no server uploads, no privacy concerns. It runs entirely on your local machine using your browser's resources.

*And if you ARE building a pipeline:* the same engine now ships as a proper CLI — `pip install litedoc-cli` — with globs, stdin/stdout, JSON envelopes, and an optional bring-your-own-model AI repair pass. See [the CLI section](#the-cli) below.

## Key Features

### Document Intelligence

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Layout Analysis** | Kahn's Topological Sort on a DAG of geometric blocks determines correct reading order across sidebars, headers, and multi-column page layouts — no horizontal text mixing. |
| **Table Extraction** | Vector line detection builds GitHub-Flavored Markdown tables with merged cell support. Extraction heuristics are tuned via Bayesian Optimization (Optuna) against synthetic layout edge-case simulations. |
| **Math Rendering** | Detects formula bounding boxes (including PUA-encoded symbols) and preserves them as high-fidelity images or KaTeX. |
| **Figure & Chart Extraction** | Vector graphics (charts, diagrams, plots) are detected from the PDF's drawing operators, cropped **with their axis labels and annotations included**, and placed above their captions in the output — instead of leaking stray label text into your prose. |
| **Gibberish Detection** | Statistical scoring identifies corrupted custom-encoded fonts and routes them to OCR fallback. |

### Privacy & Performance

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **100% Local** | All processing runs on your CPU/GPU inside the browser. Files never leave your device. |
| **Batch Processing** | Large files split into 10-page chunks. Canvas assets released dynamically to prevent memory crashes. |
| **Local Decryption** | Password-protected PDFs unlocked client-side in the browser sandbox — keys never sent anywhere. |

### Format Support & UX

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **RTL & Arabic** | Native right-to-left script support with automatic line alignment and typography routing. |
| **Smart OCR Routing** | Scans initial pages for corruption; auto-detects script direction and language, initializing Tesseract.js workers with dynamically tuned PSM modes and vertical tolerances for maximum stability. |
| **Font Fallback** | Corrupted or custom-encoded fonts intercepted with image-fallback options for readability. |
| **Mobile Responsive** | Full editor, document navigation, and settings available on any screen size. |
| **Queue Control** | Pause or skip processing tasks. "Unformat" action strips markdown styling instantly. |

### New: Optional AI Cleanup

LiteDoc now ships an opt-in **"Clean with AI"** feature: after the local parser extracts your document, an AI pass can fix leftover typos and OCR artifacts, stitch sentences broken across lines and pages, and re-align mangled tables into proper Markdown.

- **Still 100% local by default** — the AI pass is the *only* feature that talks to a server, and only for the document you explicitly send. Everything else stays in your browser, same as always.
- **Private by design** — documents are processed in memory and never written to disk, stored, or logged. Accounts are username + password only; we never ask for an email.
- **How it's funded** — AI cleanup runs on tokens purchased as gift codes from the [Ko-fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/0xovo/shop). This add-on exists so supporting the project isn't a one-way street: donors get something genuinely useful back, and every purchase keeps the servers running.

## The CLI

The full extraction engine is also available as a command-line tool for scripts and pipelines — identical output to the web app, because it drives the exact same engine headlessly:

```bash
pip install litedoc-cli
playwright install chromium        # one-time engine download

litedoc convert paper.pdf                                # markdown to stdout
litedoc convert scans/*.pdf -o out/ --ocr                # batch + OCR
litedoc convert paper.pdf -o out/ --images out/images    # extracted figures as JPEGs
litedoc convert scan.pdf --ai-url http://localhost:11434 # repair with YOUR model
```

Deterministic by default (no AI, no network). The optional AI repair pass is **triage-first**: it detects the specific sections that are actually damaged — broken sentences, ragged tables, OCR artifacts — and sends *only those* to the model, never your whole document. Point it at your own Ollama/OpenAI-compatible endpoint with `--ai-url`, or at the hosted service with `--ai`. Full docs: [`cli/README.md`](cli/README.md).

## Getting Started

Because LiteDoc is a purely client-side web application, you don't need to install any dependencies to run it!

**The Easiest Way:**
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/0xovo/LiteDoc/releases).
2. Download the `index.html` file from the latest release.
3. Open the downloaded `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) and drag and drop your PDFs!

**Run from Source:**
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Build the single-file app: `python scripts/build.py`
3. Open the generated `dist/index.html` in your browser.

### Development & Custom Builds
If you want to modify the source code:
1. Make changes inside the `src/` directory (includes modular CSS and JS).
2. Bundle your changes into a single self-contained file by running:
 ```bash
 python scripts/build.py
 ```
3. The compiled production bundle will be updated at `dist/index.html`.

### Release Workflow (Maintainers)
Releases are fully automated through a single gated controller:

```bash
python scripts/release.py --version X.Y.Z
```

It runs the complete test suite first (**any failure builds nothing**), then builds the public edition, verifies it contains no secrets or dev URLs via an automated leak scan, produces the release zip, and rebuilds the version-stamped CLI package. Only artifacts that pass every gate come out the other end. Each release ships with `RELEASE.md` — an auto-generated document with the release notes and the measured extraction benchmark for that version.

### Training & Heuristic Optimization
LiteDoc's parser is driven by a set of layout, table, and OCR heuristics (column proximity, alignment tolerances, math detection margins, and more). Those parameters are no longer hand-tuned — this repository ships the complete, open-source **Synthetic Dataset Training Pipeline** that tunes them automatically.

The pipeline procedurally generates diverse PDFs with matching ground-truth Markdown (using rendering backends like Typst, WeasyPrint, and LaTeX), degrades some of them to simulate low-quality scans, then runs continuous headless Bayesian optimization (Optuna) that scores the real parser in headless Chromium against the ground truth — including reading order, table structure, and word order.

Want to dig deeper — or train the parser on your own PDF edge cases? Everything lives in the [`training/`](training/) folder: the dataset generator, the scoring functions, the optimizer, and a live training dashboard, with step-by-step setup instructions in the [Training Pipeline README](training/README.md).

### Extracting Files
Once processing finishes, you can preview the generated Markdown directly in the built-in Ace Editor.
Click **Download Files (.zip)** to get a neatly packaged archive containing your `.md` file and an attached folder containing all extracted images, tables, and charts.

## Architecture

LiteDoc relies on a powerful stack of client-side libraries:
* **PDF.js** - Core parsing, rendering, and text-layer extraction.
* **Tesseract.js** - WebAssembly-based OCR for scanned document fallback.
* **JSZip** - Local, client-side ZIP packaging of extracted assets.
* **KaTeX** - Fast math typesetting in the Markdown previewer.
* **Ace Editor** - High-performance code editor for tweaking Markdown before export.

## How It Works: Document Layout Analysis

Unlike basic wrapper libraries that blindly extract text sequentially from top to bottom, LiteDoc utilizes advanced Document Layout Analysis (DLA) and topological graph algorithms natively in your browser. This ensures structurally perfect extractions for complex formats like multi-column scientific papers, journals, and math-heavy PDFs.

### 1. Kahn's Topological Sort (Reading Order)
After extracting text blocks, LiteDoc maps them into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using spatial constraints.
- I use **Kahn's Topological Sort** to determine the exact human reading order.
- Edges in the graph are defined by strict geometric constraints (vertical/horizontal overlap and proximity). This eliminates "column interleaving" bugs where a right column might be accidentally read before the left.

### 2. Mathematical Equation Detection
Mathematical formulas are notoriously difficult to extract because PDF engines often map math symbols to the Private Use Area (PUA) of Unicode.
- LiteDoc analyzes character densities line-by-line using an expanded Unicode math symbol set.
- When an equation block is detected ($Density_{math} > 15\%$, or shorter lines at 30%), instead of outputting corrupted text, LiteDoc geometrically calculates the bounding box of the multi-line formula.
- The region is rendered onto an offscreen web canvas and cropped into a high-fidelity image (`[IMAGE_MATH]`), preserving visual fractions and complex integrals.

### 3. Smart Gibberish Scoring
LiteDoc implements a robust Gibberish Scorer to identify heavily corrupted, custom-encoded "subset" fonts. It calculates a statistical $Suspicion Ratio$ based on illegal character blocks. When standard text fails this heuristic, LiteDoc safely isolates the text or dynamically routes the page to my WebAssembly OCR fallback (Tesseract.js) to recover the lost data.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are highly welcome! Since the goal is to keep the tool accessible and server-free, any PRs should adhere to the "100% client-side" philosophy.

**A Note on Future Updates:** Up until now, bugs and algorithmic edge-cases have been tracked manually by the maintainer. Because I currently don't have anyone actively opening issues on the repository, **future updates will be rolling out at a slower pace**. If you find a bug or want a feature, *please open an issue!* It is the best way to drive the next wave of development.
